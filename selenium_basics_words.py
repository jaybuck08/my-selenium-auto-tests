# use this below to switch the driver to other sections like; alert, i-frame etc. this means that if "driver." is used, it will be searching for elements within "alert, i-frame, etc" only. 
# in other words it will take "alert, i-frame, etc"" as the driver until is is reverted.

#driver.switch_to.frame(i_frame)

#________________________________________________________________________________________

# use this to go back to default driver

#driver.switch_to.default_content()
